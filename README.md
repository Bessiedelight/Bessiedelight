 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Bessie's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   My coding journey began with a passion for solving real-world problems through technology. As a Computer Science student at the University of Cape Coast, I discovered my calling in healthcare technology when I realized how AI could revolutionize patient care and medical efficiency. This led me to specialize in AI integration, particularly in healthcare applications.

   From building my first React application to winning the UCC Hackathon 2024 with an innovative healthcare solution, I've consistently pushed the boundaries of what's possible with modern web technologies. My expertise spans from frontend frameworks like React and Next.js to backend systems with Node.js, and advanced AI integrations using LangChain and various ML models.

   What drives me is the opportunity to create technology that makes a real difference in people's lives - whether it's helping patients get better care through AI-powered health assistants or enabling doctors to work more efficiently with intelligent automation tools. Every project I build is designed with the end user in mind, focusing on solving genuine problems rather than just showcasing technical skills.

   As I continue my journey, I'm excited about the future of healthcare technology and my role in building solutions that bridge the gap between cutting-edge AI and practical medical applications. The goal isn't just to write code - it's to create technology that saves lives and improves healthcare outcomes for everyone.
